# LINKS

Here are my recommended link of the week! I found these links helpful to learn the topics for OS this week. 

1. [Number One](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/software-monetization/protecting-software-intellectual-property)<br>
This page helps me understand what is Software Intellectual Property and its types, such as Patents, Copyright, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets. The page itself is quiet comprehensive and I believe is enough to give a brief understanding of the regarding topic.
